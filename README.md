## 🌍 What is Linux?
Linux is an open-source operating system that powers most of the world’s servers, cloud systems, and even Android phones. Unlike Windows or macOS, Linux is free, customizable, and heavily used in software engineering, DevOps, cybersecurity, and system administration.  

It’s built around the **Linux kernel**, which controls the hardware, and comes in many distributions (like Ubuntu, CentOS, Fedora, and Debian).  



## 🔧 Uses of Linux OS
Linux is widely used because of its stability, flexibility, and security. Some common uses are:
- **Servers & Cloud**: Powers websites, databases, and cloud platforms (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure).  
- **Software Development**: Programming, DevOps pipelines, and automation.  
- **Cybersecurity & Networking**: Used in penetration testing (Kali Linux) and firewalls.  
- **Embedded Systems**: Runs on devices like routers, smart TVs, and IoT gadgets.  
- **Everyday Computing**: Desktop distributions like Ubuntu for personal use.  
- **Mobile**: Android is built on the Linux kernel.  



## 🏗️ Components of Linux and Their Functions
1. **Kernel** → The core of Linux, manages hardware, processes, memory, and devices.  
2. **Shell** → Command-line interpreter (e.g., Bash, Zsh) that lets users communicate with the kernel.  
3. **File System** → Organizes data in directories and files (everything in Linux is treated as a file).  
4. **System Libraries** → Provide standard functions for programs (like `glibc`).  
5. **System Utilities** → Basic tools (like `ls`, `cp`, `mv`) to manage the system.  
6. **Applications** → Software installed on Linux (like VS Code, browsers, servers).

## 🗂️ Linux File System Hierarchy — Study Summary

The **Linux File System Hierarchy** defines how files and directories are organized on a Linux system.  
Everything in Linux is treated as a **file** — even hardware devices and processes.

At the top of the structure is the **root directory `/`**, which contains all other files and folders in a tree-like structure.



###  Top-Level Directories

| Directory | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `/` | The **root directory** — everything starts here. It’s the base of the Linux file system tree. |
| `/bin` | Essential **user binaries** (programs) needed for the system to boot and run, such as `ls`, `cp`, `mv`, `cat`. |
| `/boot` | Contains files required for **booting the system**, including the Linux kernel (`vmlinuz`) and bootloader configuration (`grub`). |
| `/dev` | Contains **device files** — these represent hardware devices like disks (`/dev/sda`), terminals, and USBs. |
| `/etc` | System-wide **configuration files** for software and services. Example: `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/hosts`. |
| `/home` | Each user’s **personal directory**. Example: `/home/sarah` stores personal files, downloads, and configs. |
| `/lib`, `/lib64` | Essential **shared libraries** needed by system programs and the kernel. Similar to DLL files in Windows. |
| `/media` | Used to **mount external drives** (USBs, CDs, DVDs) automatically. |
| `/mnt` | A **temporary mount point** for manually mounted devices or partitions. |
| `/opt` | Used for **optional or third-party software** (e.g., apps installed outside the package manager). |
| `/proc` | A **virtual directory** that provides information about system and process status in real-time. Example: `/proc/cpuinfo`. |
| `/root` | The **home directory for the root (admin) user** — different from `/`. |
| `/run` | Stores **runtime data** like system information since boot. |
| `/sbin` | System binaries used by the **root user** for administrative tasks (e.g., `ifconfig`, `reboot`). |
| `/srv` | Contains **service data** for servers like FTP, HTTP, and databases. |
| `/sys` | Provides system and device information — used by the kernel and hardware drivers. |
| `/tmp` | Temporary files created by users or processes. Cleared after reboot. |
| `/usr` | Stands for **Unix System Resources**. Contains user programs, libraries, documentation, and utilities. |
| `/var` | Holds **variable data** like logs, emails, databases, and caches. Example: `/var/log/syslog`. |



### 🧩 Simplified Analogy

Think of Linux like a **house**:

| Linux Directory | Analogy |
|------------------|---------|
| `/` | 🏠 The entire property (foundation) |
| `/home` | 🛏️ Your personal bedroom |
| `/etc` | ⚙️ The control panel (settings) |
| `/bin` | 🧰 Everyday tools |
| `/var/log` | 📹 CCTV recordings (system logs) |
| `/dev` | 🔌 Electrical wiring and plumbing (hardware) |

### 🔍 Key Notes

- The **root (`/`) directory** is not the same as `/root`.  
  - `/` is the entire system’s top level.  
  - `/root` is the root user’s personal directory.  
- Linux is **case-sensitive**: `/Home` ≠ `/home`.  
- Use **absolute paths** (`/etc/passwd`) for system operations.  
- Access rights are controlled by **permissions and ownership**.

## 🔐 Linux File Permissions and Ownership — Study Summary

In Linux, **file permissions and ownership** control **who can read, write, or execute** a file or directory.  
This security model ensures that users and processes can only access what they are allowed to.

---

### 🧭 The Three Permission Types

| Permission | Symbol | Description | Example |
|-------------|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Read** | `r` | View file contents or list directory contents. | `cat file.txt` |
| **Write** | `w` | Modify file contents or add/delete files in a directory. | `nano file.txt` |
| **Execute** | `x` | Run files (programs/scripts) or enter directories. | `./script.sh` |

---

### 👥 File Ownership in Linux

Each file or directory in Linux has **three types of owners:**

| Owner Type | Description |
|-------------|--------------|
| **User (u)** | The person who created the file. |
| **Group (g)** | A set of users with shared access. |
| **Others (o)** | Everyone else on the system. |

You can view ownership and permissions using:
```bash
ls -l

Example Output:

-rwxr-xr--  1 sarah devops  2450 Oct 6 10:20 script.sh

Breakdown:
| Section  | Meaning                                         |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `-`      | File type (`-` = file, `d` = directory)         |
| `rwx`    | Permissions for **user** (read, write, execute) |
| `r-x`    | Permissions for **group** (read, execute)       |
| `r--`    | Permissions for **others** (read only)          |
| `sarah`  | File owner                                      |
| `devops` | Group owner                                     |

🔢 Numeric (Octal) Representation
Permissions can also be expressed as numbers (0–7), known as octal notation.

| Number | Permission | Binary | Meaning                |
| ------ | ---------- | ------ | ---------------------- |
| `0`    | ---        | 000    | No permissions         |
| `1`    | --x        | 001    | Execute only           |
| `2`    | -w-        | 010    | Write only             |
| `3`    | -wx        | 011    | Write + Execute        |
| `4`    | r--        | 100    | Read only              |
| `5`    | r-x        | 101    | Read + Execute         |
| `6`    | rw-        | 110    | Read + Write           |
| `7`    | rwx        | 111    | Read + Write + Execute |

so:
`chmod 755 file.sh` → User: `rwx`, Group: `r-x`, Others: `r-x`

`chmod 644 file.txt` → User: `rw`-, Group: `r--`, Others: `r--`

⚙️ Managing Permissions

1. Change permissions with chmod
# Add execute permission for user
`chmod u+x script.sh`

# Remove write permission for group
`chmod g-w notes.txt`

# Give read permission to everyone
`chmod a+r data.log`

# Set numeric permissions (User=7, Group=5, Others=5)
`chmod 755 script.sh`

2. Change ownership with chown
# Change owner of a file
`sudo chown sarah file.txt`

# Change owner and group
`sudo chown sarah:devops file.`txt`

# Change ownership recursively in a directory
`sudo chown -R sarah:devops /project`

3. Change group with 

`sudo chgrp developers report.txt`

📂 File Type Indicators (from ls -l)

| Symbol | Type             | Example      |
| ------ | ---------------- | ------------ |
| `-`    | Regular file     | `-rw-r--r--` |
| `d`    | Directory        | `drwxr-xr-x` |
| `l`    | Symbolic link    | `lrwxrwxrwx` |
| `b`    | Block device     | `brw-rw----` |
| `c`    | Character device | `crw-rw----` |
| `p`    | Named pipe       | `prw-r--r--` |
| `s`    | Socket           | `srwxr-xr-x` |

🧩 Practical Examples

# View permissions and ownership
ls -l

# Make a script executable
chmod +x deploy.sh

# Give group write permission
chmod g+w report.txt

# Change file ownership to 'sarah'
sudo chown sarah script.sh

Quick Recap
| Concept                                             | Description |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| **Read (r)** → View files or directories.           |             |
| **Write (w)** → Modify files or directory contents. |             |
| **Execute (x)** → Run scripts or enter directories. |             |
| **chmod** → Change permissions.                     |             |
| **chown / chgrp** → Change ownership and groups.    |             |
| **ls -l** → View permission and ownership details.  |             |

Practice Commands
# Create a sample file
touch test.sh

# Check permissions
ls -l test.sh

# Give user full rights, others read-only
chmod 744 test.sh

# Assign to a group
sudo chown $USER:devops test.sh


Tip
When setting permissions, always follow the principle of least privilege 
give users only the access they truly need to keep your system secure.
