# Linux Learning Lab

## 🌍 What is Linux?
Linux is an open-source operating system that powers most of the world’s servers, cloud systems, and even Android phones. Unlike Windows or macOS, Linux is free, customizable, and heavily used in software engineering, DevOps, cybersecurity, and system administration.  

It’s built around the **Linux kernel**, which controls the hardware, and comes in many distributions (like Ubuntu, CentOS, Fedora, and Debian).  



## 🔧 Uses of Linux OS
Linux is widely used because of its stability, flexibility, and security. Some common uses are:
- **Servers & Cloud**: Powers websites, databases, and cloud platforms (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure).  
- **Software Development**: Programming, DevOps pipelines, and automation.  
- **Cybersecurity & Networking**: Used in penetration testing (Kali Linux) and firewalls.  
- **Embedded Systems**: Runs on devices like routers, smart TVs, and IoT gadgets.  
- **Everyday Computing**: Desktop distributions like Ubuntu for personal use.  
- **Mobile**: Android is built on the Linux kernel.  



## 🏗️ Components of Linux and Their Functions
1. **Kernel** → The core of Linux, manages hardware, processes, memory, and devices.  
2. **Shell** → Command-line interpreter (e.g., Bash, Zsh) that lets users communicate with the kernel.  
3. **File System** → Organizes data in directories and files (everything in Linux is treated as a file).  
4. **System Libraries** → Provide standard functions for programs (like `glibc`).  
5. **System Utilities** → Basic tools (like `ls`, `cp`, `mv`) to manage the system.  
6. **Applications** → Software installed on Linux (like VS Code, browsers, servers).

## 🗂️ Linux File System Hierarchy — Study Summary

The **Linux File System Hierarchy** defines how files and directories are organized on a Linux system.  
Everything in Linux is treated as a **file** — even hardware devices and processes.

At the top of the structure is the **root directory `/`**, which contains all other files and folders in a tree-like structure.



###  Top-Level Directories

| Directory | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `/` | The **root directory** — everything starts here. It’s the base of the Linux file system tree. |
| `/bin` | Essential **user binaries** (programs) needed for the system to boot and run, such as `ls`, `cp`, `mv`, `cat`. |
| `/boot` | Contains files required for **booting the system**, including the Linux kernel (`vmlinuz`) and bootloader configuration (`grub`). |
| `/dev` | Contains **device files** — these represent hardware devices like disks (`/dev/sda`), terminals, and USBs. |
| `/etc` | System-wide **configuration files** for software and services. Example: `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/hosts`. |
| `/home` | Each user’s **personal directory**. Example: `/home/sarah` stores personal files, downloads, and configs. |
| `/lib`, `/lib64` | Essential **shared libraries** needed by system programs and the kernel. Similar to DLL files in Windows. |
| `/media` | Used to **mount external drives** (USBs, CDs, DVDs) automatically. |
| `/mnt` | A **temporary mount point** for manually mounted devices or partitions. |
| `/opt` | Used for **optional or third-party software** (e.g., apps installed outside the package manager). |
| `/proc` | A **virtual directory** that provides information about system and process status in real-time. Example: `/proc/cpuinfo`. |
| `/root` | The **home directory for the root (admin) user** — different from `/`. |
| `/run` | Stores **runtime data** like system information since boot. |
| `/sbin` | System binaries used by the **root user** for administrative tasks (e.g., `ifconfig`, `reboot`). |
| `/srv` | Contains **service data** for servers like FTP, HTTP, and databases. |
| `/sys` | Provides system and device information — used by the kernel and hardware drivers. |
| `/tmp` | Temporary files created by users or processes. Cleared after reboot. |
| `/usr` | Stands for **Unix System Resources**. Contains user programs, libraries, documentation, and utilities. |
| `/var` | Holds **variable data** like logs, emails, databases, and caches. Example: `/var/log/syslog`. |



### 🧩 Simplified Analogy

Think of Linux like a **house**:

| Linux Directory | Analogy |
|------------------|---------|
| `/` | 🏠 The entire property (foundation) |
| `/home` | 🛏️ Your personal bedroom |
| `/etc` | ⚙️ The control panel (settings) |
| `/bin` | 🧰 Everyday tools |
| `/var/log` | 📹 CCTV recordings (system logs) |
| `/dev` | 🔌 Electrical wiring and plumbing (hardware) |

### 🔍 Key Notes

- The **root (`/`) directory** is not the same as `/root`.  
  - `/` is the entire system’s top level.  
  - `/root` is the root user’s personal directory.  
- Linux is **case-sensitive**: `/Home` ≠ `/home`.  
- Use **absolute paths** (`/etc/passwd`) for system operations.  
- Access rights are controlled by **permissions and ownership**.

# 🔐 Linux File Permissions and Ownership

In Linux, **file permissions and ownership** control **who can read, write, or execute** a file or directory.  
This security model ensures that users and processes can only access what they are allowed to.

---

### 🧭 The Three Permission Types

| Permission | Symbol | Description | Example |
|-------------|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Read** | `r` | View file contents or list directory contents. | `cat file.txt` |
| **Write** | `w` | Modify file contents or add/delete files in a directory. | `nano file.txt` |
| **Execute** | `x` | Run files (programs/scripts) or enter directories. | `./script.sh` |

---

### 👥 File Ownership in Linux

Each file or directory in Linux has **three types of owners:**

| Owner Type | Description |
|-------------|--------------|
| **User (u)** | The person who created the file. |
| **Group (g)** | A set of users with shared access. |
| **Others (o)** | Everyone else on the system. |

You can view ownership and permissions using:

ls -l

Example Output:

-rwxr-xr--  1 sarah devops  2450 Oct 6 10:20 script.sh

Breakdown:
| Section  | Meaning                                         |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `-`      | File type (`-` = file, `d` = directory)         |
| `rwx`    | Permissions for **user** (read, write, execute) |
| `r-x`    | Permissions for **group** (read, execute)       |
| `r--`    | Permissions for **others** (read only)          |
| `sarah`  | File owner                                      |
| `devops` | Group owner                                     |

🔢 Numeric (Octal) Representation
Permissions can also be expressed as numbers (0–7), known as octal notation.

| Number | Permission | Binary | Meaning                |
| ------ | ---------- | ------ | ---------------------- |
| `0`    | ---        | 000    | No permissions         |
| `1`    | --x        | 001    | Execute only           |
| `2`    | -w-        | 010    | Write only             |
| `3`    | -wx        | 011    | Write + Execute        |
| `4`    | r--        | 100    | Read only              |
| `5`    | r-x        | 101    | Read + Execute         |
| `6`    | rw-        | 110    | Read + Write           |
| `7`    | rwx        | 111    | Read + Write + Execute |

so:
`chmod 755 file.sh` → User: `rwx`, Group: `r-x`, Others: `r-x`

`chmod 644 file.txt` → User: `rw`-, Group: `r--`, Others: `r--`

# ⚙️ Managing Permissions

## 1. Change permissions with chmod
### Add execute permission for user
`chmod u+x script.sh`

### Remove write permission for group
`chmod g-w notes.txt`

### Give read permission to everyone
`chmod a+r data.log`

### Set numeric permissions (User=7, Group=5, Others=5)
`chmod 755 script.sh`

## 2. Change ownership with chown
### Change owner of a file
`sudo chown sarah file.txt`

### Change owner and group
`sudo chown sarah:devops file.`txt`

### Change ownership recursively in a directory
`sudo chown -R sarah:devops /project`

## 3. Change group with 

`sudo chgrp developers report.txt`

### 📂 File Type Indicators (from ls -l)

| Symbol | Type             | Example      |
| ------ | ---------------- | ------------ |
| `-`    | Regular file     | `-rw-r--r--` |
| `d`    | Directory        | `drwxr-xr-x` |
| `l`    | Symbolic link    | `lrwxrwxrwx` |
| `b`    | Block device     | `brw-rw----` |
| `c`    | Character device | `crw-rw----` |
| `p`    | Named pipe       | `prw-r--r--` |
| `s`    | Socket           | `srwxr-xr-x` |

🧩 Practical Examples

### View permissions and ownership
ls -l

### Make a script executable
chmod +x deploy.sh

### Give group write permission
chmod g+w report.txt

### Change file ownership to 'sarah'
sudo chown sarah script.sh

Quick Recap
| Concept                                             | Description |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| **Read (r)** → View files or directories.           |             |
| **Write (w)** → Modify files or directory contents. |             |
| **Execute (x)** → Run scripts or enter directories. |             |
| **chmod** → Change permissions.                     |             |
| **chown / chgrp** → Change ownership and groups.    |             |
| **ls -l** → View permission and ownership details.  |             |

###  Practice Commands
Create a sample file
touch test.sh

### Check permissions
ls -l test.sh

### Give user full rights, others read-only
chmod 744 test.sh

### Assign to a group
sudo chown $USER:devops test.sh


# Tip
When setting permissions, always follow the principle of least privilege 
give users only the access they truly need to keep your system secure.


##### Always check if an editor is installed

`which vim`
`which nano`

##### To install any missing editor

`sudo apt install vim `  # or nano, gedit, emacs, kate

#### You can set yur preferred editor using

`export EDITOR=vim`


# 🔐 Access Control Lists (ACL) in Linux

In Linux, **Access Control Lists (ACLs)** give you *superpowers* over file permissions!  
They allow you to go **beyond the basic `rwx` permissions** (read, write, execute) and assign **specific access rights** to multiple users or groups — not just the file owner or group.

Think of ACLs as giving out **special VIP passes** to certain users for your files or folders. 🎟️



## 🎯 Why Use ACLs?

The regular Linux permissions system (owner, group, others) looks like this: 

` -rw-r--r--`

That means:
- Owner can **read/write**
- Group can **read**
- Others can **read**

But what if you want **one extra user** (not the owner or in the group) to also write to the file?

That’s where **ACLs** come in — they give you that extra control. 💪



## ⚙️ Enabling ACLs (if not already enabled)

Most modern Linux systems have ACLs enabled by default.  
To check if a filesystem supports it, run:

`mount | grep acl`
If it's not enabled, you can remount with:

`sudo mount -o remount,acl / `

## 🧩 Viewing ACLs
To see which ACLs are set on a file or directory:

` getfacl filename `

Example output:

 file: report.txt
 owner: sarah
 group: staff

user::rw-
user:alex:rw-
group::r--
mask::rw-
other::r--

Explanation:

user::rw- → file owner (Sarah)

user:alex:rw- → special ACL entry for Alex

group::r-- → group permissions

mask::rw- → maximum allowed permissions for users/groups

other::r-- → everyone else

## 🛠️ Setting ACLs
### ✅ Give a user permission to a file:

`setfacl -m u:alex:rw filename`
This gives Alex read and write access to `filename`

### ✅ Give a group permission to a directory:

`setfacl -m g:developers:rwx /project`
Now, all users in developers group can read, write and execute inside `/project`

### ✅ Apply ACLs recursively (to all files and folders inside a directory):

`setfacl -R -m u:alex:rw /project`

### ✅ Remove an ACL entry:

`setfacl -x u:alex filename`

### ✅ Remove all ACLs from a file:

`setfacl -b filename`

## Default ACLs for New Files

### You can set default ACLs so that any new files created inside a directory automatically inherit specific permissions.

`setfacl -m d:u:alex:rwx /shared`
Here, any file created inside `/shared` automatically gives Alex full access.

## 🧠 Quick Summary

| Command                        | Meaning                        |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| `getfacl file`                 | View ACLs for a file           |
| `setfacl -m u:user:perm file`  | Add or modify ACL for a user   |
| `setfacl -m g:group:perm dir`  | Add or modify ACL for a group  |
| `setfacl -x u:user file`       | Remove a specific user’s ACL   |
| `setfacl -b file`              | Remove all ACLs                |
| `setfacl -R`                   | Apply changes recursively      |
| `setfacl -m d:u:user:perm dir` | Set default ACLs for new files |


## 🧩 Pro Tip:
### To make sure ACLs are active on your system:

`sudo tune2fs -l /dev/sda1 | grep "Default mount options"`

If `acl` isn't listed, enable it in `/etc/fstab` by adding `acl` to your filesystem options.


## 💡 Real-Life Example

Imagine you’re working on a shared project folder `/project` with two colleagues:

You own the folder.

You want Alex to edit files.

You want Kim to only read files.

Here’s how you do it:
`setfacl -m u:alex:rw /project`
`setfacl -m u:kim:r /project`

Now both Alex and Kim have exactly the permissions they need — and you didn’t have to change the main ownership or group structure!


# 👥 User and Group Management in Linux

Linux is a **multi-user operating system**, meaning multiple people (or processes) can use the same system without interfering with one another.  
To keep everything organized and secure, Linux uses **users** and **groups** to control *who* can access *what*.

Let’s break it down in a fun and simple way! 



## 🧑‍💻 What is a User?

A **user** is anyone (or anything) that can log in to a Linux system.  
Every user has:
- A **username**
- A **password**
- A **home directory** (e.g., `/home/sarah`)
- A **unique user ID (UID)**

🧩 You can view your current user:

`whoami`
👀 Or view all system users:

`cat /etc/passwd`

Each Line in /etc/password looks like this:

`sarah:x:1000:1000:Sarah:/home/sarah:/bin/bash`

Explanation:

sarah → Username

`x` → Password (stored encrypted in /etc/shadow)

`1000` → User ID (UID)

`1000` → Group ID (GID)

`Sarah` → User info/comment

`/home/sarah` → Home directory

`/bin/bash` → Default shell

## 👨‍👩‍👧 What is a Group?

A group is a collection of users.
Groups make it easy to assign the same permissions to multiple people.

👀 See all groups:

`cat /etc/group`

Example line:

`developers:x:1001:alex,kim`

This means:

Group name: `developers`

Members: `alex` and `kim`

## 🧩 Managing Users
### ✅ Create a New User

`sudo adduser john`

This creates:

`/home/john` directory

Default shell `/bin/bash`

Entry in `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow`

### ✅ Set or Change a User Password

`sudo passwd john`

### ✅ Delete a User

`sudo deluser john`

#### To delete the user and their home directory:

`sudo deluser --remove-home john`

### ✅ Modify a User
#### Change user info or settings:

`sudo usermod -l newname oldname`

Example: rename user from `john` to `johnny`

#### To change a user's home directory:

`sudo usermod -d /new/home john`

## 🧩 Managing Groups
### ✅ Create a Group

`sudo addgroup developers`

### ✅ Add a User to a Group

`sudo usermod -aG developers john`

(The -aG means “append to group” — don’t forget it!)

### ✅ Remove a User from a Group

`sudo gpasswd -d john developers`

### ✅ Delete a Group

`sudo delgroup developers`

## 👀 Viewing User & Group Info

| Command           | Description                               |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `id`              | Show your UID, GID, and group memberships |
| `groups`          | List groups you belong to                 |
| `finger username` | Display user details                      |
| `getent passwd`   | View all user entries                     |
| `getent group`    | View all group entries                    |

## 🔐 Special Files

| File           | Description         |
| -------------- | ------------------- |
| `/etc/passwd`  | List of all users   |
| `/etc/shadow`  | Encrypted passwords |
| `/etc/group`   | List of all groups  |
| `/etc/gshadow` | Secure group info   |

## ⚙️ Default Users

Linux systems often come with special built-in users:
| User     | Purpose                         |
| -------- | ------------------------------- |
| `root`   | Superuser (has all permissions) |
| `daemon` | Runs background services        |
| `nobody` | Used for limited-access tasks   |

## 🌈 Practical Example

##### You’re managing a small DevOps team:

Sarah → admin

Alex → developer

Kim → tester

##### You can set it up like this:

`sudo addgroup devops`
`sudo adduser alex`
`sudo adduser kim`
`sudo usermod -aG devops alex`
`sudo usermod -aG devops kim`

Now both Alex and Kim belong to the devops group, and you can give the group permission to access project files easily.

Example:

`sudo chown :devops /project`
`sudo chmod 770 /project`

### ✅ Result: Only users in devops (Alex and Kim) can access /project.

# ⚙️ Process Management in Linux

Every task that runs in Linux — whether it’s opening a file, running a browser, or starting a web server — is called a **process**.  
Understanding and managing processes is one of the most important Linux skills, especially for **DevOps engineers**, **admins**, and **power users**. 


## 🧩 What is a Process?

A **process** is simply a program in execution.  
Each process has:
- A **PID** (Process ID)
- A **user** who started it
- A **state** (running, sleeping, stopped, etc.)
- A **priority**
- And it consumes some **CPU** and **memory**

To see your currently running processes:

`ps`

To see them in a detailed view:

`ps -ef`

## 🔍 Viewing Processes
### ✅ List All Running Processes

`ps aux`

Shows all processes by all users in a full-format listing.

| Column  | Meaning                     |
| ------- | --------------------------- |
| USER    | Owner of the process        |
| PID     | Process ID                  |
| %CPU    | CPU usage                   |
| %MEM    | Memory usage                |
| COMMAND | Name of the running command |

## ✅ Real-Time Process Monitoring

`top`

This opens a live dashboard of system performance.

Press:

`q` → to quit

`k` → to kill a process

`P` → to sort by CPU usage

`M` → to sort by memory usage

#### 💡 Modern alternative:

`htop`

(You might need to install it using sudo apt install htop.)
It’s colorful and interactive — much easier to read!

## 🧠 Finding Specific Processes
### ✅ Search for a Process by Name

`ps aux | grep nginx`
Finds all processes related to “nginx.”

### ✅ Get Process Tree View

`pstree`
Shows which processes started others (parent/child relationships).

## 🧰 Managing Processes
### ✅ Start a Process

`./script.sh`

or run a command directly:

`python3 app.py`

### ✅ Stop (Kill) a Process

`kill <PID>`

Example:

`kill 2020`

If it refuses to stop:

`kill -9 2020`

💀 The -9 flag forces termination.

### ✅ Suspend a Process (Pause It)

`kill -STOP <PID>`

### ✅ Resume a Stopped Process

`kill -CONT <PID>`

## ⏫ Managing Background & Foreground Jobs

You can send processes to the background or bring them back to the foreground easily.

### ✅ Run a Process in the Background

`python3 app.py &`

The & makes it run in the background.

### ✅ List Background Jobs

`jobs`

### ✅ Bring a Background Job to Foreground

`fg %1`

### ✅ Send a Running Process to Background

Press:
`Ctrl + Z`

Then type:
`bg`

## 🧮 Priority & Nice Values

Each process has a priority that determines how much CPU time it gets.

### ✅ Start a Process with Low Priority

`nice -n 10 python3 app.py`

### ✅ Change Priority of a Running Process

`renice -n 5 -p 2020`

Lower numbers = higher priority
Range: -20 (highest) → 19 (lowest)

## 🧾 Checking Resource Usage

### ✅ CPU and Memory Usage per Process

`top`

Or

`ps aux --sort=-%mem | head`

Shows tops processes by memory usage.

## 🧩 System Monitoring Commands
| Command         | Description                         |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `ps aux`        | List all running processes          |
| `top`           | Real-time process monitor           |
| `htop`          | Interactive version of top          |
| `pstree`        | Show process hierarchy              |
| `kill <PID>`    | Terminate a process                 |
| `kill -9 <PID>` | Force-kill a process                |
| `jobs`          | List background jobs                |
| `fg` / `bg`     | Bring jobs to foreground/background |
| `nice`          | Start process with priority         |
| `renice`        | Change priority of running process  |
| `pgrep <name>`  | Find PID of process by name         |
| `pkill <name>`  | Kill processes by name              |


## 🌈 Practical Example

Let’s say you started a Python app and want to manage it:

`python3 app.py &`

You check it’s running:

`ps aux | grep app.py`

You find it’s PID is 3020.

Then, to stop it:

`kill 3020`

Or, if it's stubborn:

`kill -9 3020`

# 🧭 System Control in Linux

System control is all about **managing system services, processes, and states**. Think of it as being the "director" of your Linux system, you tell which services start, stop, restart, or run automatically at boot.



## ⚙️ What Is `systemctl`?

`systemctl` is the command-line tool used to **interact with the systemd system and service manager**. It lets you manage system daemons (background services) and the overall system state.

You can use it to:
- Start or stop services
- Enable or disable them at startup
- Check the status of services
- Reboot or power off the system
- Manage system targets (like runlevels)



## 🚀 Common `systemctl` Commands

| Task | Command | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| Check status of a service | `systemctl status ssh` | Shows whether the SSH service is active or not |
| Start a service | `sudo systemctl start apache2` | Starts the Apache web server immediately |
| Stop a service | `sudo systemctl stop apache2` | Stops the Apache web server |
| Restart a service | `sudo systemctl restart apache2` | Restarts the service (useful after config changes) |
| Enable a service at boot | `sudo systemctl enable apache2` | Makes it start automatically on boot |
| Disable a service at boot | `sudo systemctl disable apache2` | Prevents it from starting automatically |
| Reload all services | `sudo systemctl daemon-reload` | Reloads systemd manager configuration |


## 💡 Checking System State

You can manage the **entire system state** using systemctl too:

| Action | Command |
|--------|----------|
| Reboot the system | `sudo systemctl reboot` |
| Power off the system | `sudo systemctl poweroff` |
| Put the system to sleep | `sudo systemctl suspend` |
| Show current runlevel | `systemctl get-default` |
| Change to multi-user mode | `sudo systemctl isolate multi-user.target` |



## 🧩 Example Scenario

Let’s say you installed Nginx but it didn’t start automatically. You can do:

`sudo systemctl start nginx`
`sudo systemctl enable nginx`

Now Nginx will start automatically every time you boot up.

## Bonus Tip

You can list all active services by running:

`systemctl list-units --type=service`

Or see failed services:

`systemctl --failed`

## 🧠 Summary

`systemctl` controls system services and overall system state.

It replaces older commands like `service` and `chkconfig`.

**Knowing how to use it helps you keep your Linux system healthy, efficient, and predictable.**

“Mastering `systemctl` makes you the system’s orchestra conductor, service dances to your tune!”



## 🔒 System Permissions & Ownership

In Linux, **permissions and ownership** control who can read, write, or execute files.  
Think of it as a *security badge system* ,users get specific access to specific areas.

In system  permission and onwership the same rules are followed as discussed in the file permission section. 

Just to have a quick recap on what already mentioned above:

## 🧍 Understanding Users, Groups, and Others

Each file in Linux has **three levels of access**:

| Level | Who it Applies To | Example |
|--------|-------------------|----------|
| **User (u)** | The owner of the file | You, the creator |
| **Group (g)** | Members of the file’s group | Team members |
| **Others (o)** | Everyone else | Public access |



## 🔐 File Permissions

Every file or directory has **three types of permissions**:

| Permission | Symbol | What it Means |
|-------------|---------|----------------|
| **Read** | `r` | View file contents or list directory |
| **Write** | `w` | Modify file or directory contents |
| **Execute** | `x` | Run the file as a program |



### Example:

Run:

`ls -l`  output might look like: `-rwxr-xr--`
Breakdown:

`-` → Regular file (not a directory)

`rwx` → User can read, write, execute

`r-x` → Group can read, execute

`r--` → Others can read only

## 🧮 Numeric Permissions (Octal Mode)

This is the most common way of giving permissions, it's neat and easy to apply.

Each permission has a number:


| Permission  | Value |
| ----------- | ----- |
| Read (r)    | 4     |
| Write (w)   | 2     |
| Execute (x) | 1     |

To calculate total permission, add the numbers together.

| Access | Numeric Value | Meaning                |
| ------ | ------------- | ---------------------- |
| `rwx`  | 7             | Read + Write + Execute |
| `rw-`  | 6             | Read + Write           |
| `r--`  | 4             | Read only              |

Example:

`chmod 755 script.sh`

Means: 
User → 7 (rwx)

Group → 5 (r-x)

Others → 5 (r-x)

## 🧠 Summary

Linux permissions = Who can Read, Write, or Execute.

Ownership defines who controls the file.

Use `chmod`, ``chown`, and `chgrp` to manage access.

**Always handle permissions carefully, one wrong number can expose your entire system!**

“Good permissions management is like giving keys only to the right people, not everyone needs access to the vault.”
