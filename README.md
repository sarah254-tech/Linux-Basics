# Linux-Basics
This repository is my personal Linux learning log and cheat sheet. It contains simple notes, commands, and examples that I'm practicing while learning the Linux operating system.

The goal is to keep everything short, clear, and easy to reference, like a quick guide for students and beginners.

## Goals
- Learn basic terminal commands
- Write shell scripts
- Configure a web server
- Document progress and commands

## How I work
Each day I create a short log entry under `logs/` with the date and what I practiced.

## Quick commands used
- `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade`
- `git clone <repo>`
- `ssh user@host`
- `nano|vim|code .`

## Progress
- 2025-10-02: Created repo, set up VM, installed VS Code.

## üåç What is Linux?
Linux is an open-source operating system that powers most of the world‚Äôs servers, cloud systems, and even Android phones. Unlike Windows or macOS, Linux is free, customizable, and heavily used in software engineering, DevOps, cybersecurity, and system administration.  

It‚Äôs built around the **Linux kernel**, which controls the hardware, and comes in many distributions (like Ubuntu, CentOS, Fedora, and Debian).  



## üîß Uses of Linux OS
Linux is widely used because of its stability, flexibility, and security. Some common uses are:
- **Servers & Cloud**: Powers websites, databases, and cloud platforms (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure).  
- **Software Development**: Programming, DevOps pipelines, and automation.  
- **Cybersecurity & Networking**: Used in penetration testing (Kali Linux) and firewalls.  
- **Embedded Systems**: Runs on devices like routers, smart TVs, and IoT gadgets.  
- **Everyday Computing**: Desktop distributions like Ubuntu for personal use.  
- **Mobile**: Android is built on the Linux kernel.  



## üèóÔ∏è Components of Linux and Their Functions
1. **Kernel** ‚Üí The core of Linux, manages hardware, processes, memory, and devices.  
2. **Shell** ‚Üí Command-line interpreter (e.g., Bash, Zsh) that lets users communicate with the kernel.  
3. **File System** ‚Üí Organizes data in directories and files (everything in Linux is treated as a file).  
4. **System Libraries** ‚Üí Provide standard functions for programs (like `glibc`).  
5. **System Utilities** ‚Üí Basic tools (like `ls`, `cp`, `mv`) to manage the system.  
6. **Applications** ‚Üí Software installed on Linux (like VS Code, browsers, servers).  



# üìñ Linux Command Cheat Sheet (DevOps Focus)
